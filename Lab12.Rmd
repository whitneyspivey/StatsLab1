1. Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.

No, linear regression would not be appropriate for this data because it assumes that the data set is normal distributed. In this case, There appears to be a negative linear relationship from X 1-10 and a positive linear relationship from X 10-20. If you were to do a linear regression, the two relationships would just balance each other out.
